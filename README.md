Welcome to my Canny Edge Detector!

I have replicated the Canny Edge detector provided by OpenCV to:
1. Putting my python skills to the test.
2. Experiment with an edge detection algorithm.
3. Work on a computer vision project.

I will be adjusting this project for as long as I can. Feel free to use this code 
as a template to make your edge deetection program.
